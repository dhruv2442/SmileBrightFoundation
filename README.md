# Problem

### Many people in our community/society wish to give their home items that they will not use in the future or that they do not want to use in the future. So, if someone wants to give, he or she searches for needy people or NGOs, but they have no means of knowing if the individual or the NGO is genuine or not. The NGOs are striving to aid the poor, but they are unable to do so due to a lack of funding or benefactors willing to help the poor.

# Solution

### So, as a **Smile Bright Foundation**, we've come up with a way for donors and NGOs to work together to bring a smile to the faces of those in need. One platform where potential donors can register and submit information about the item they wish to gift. NGOs that have joined the platform will be able to see these details and contact with the donor. Then NGOs bring those items and distribute them to individuals in need.
